  "description": "<p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are the perfect file type for basic icons and vector web graphics. Along with their low filesize, they can also be quickly manipulated and updated with ease. Controllable SVG animation only increases the value of this modern image filetype.</p>\n\n<p>You may have seen some animated icons or logotypes on our Dribbble profile. With most browsers now supporting SVG image types, it’s a lot easier to dynamically animate any vector artwork.</p>\n\n<p>Animated icons or logotypes can draw your attention but should always be used to serve a purpose. When done correctly, icons can help you guide users intuitively through a workflow and improve the flow. However, when used incorrectly, they can confuse your users, lead them down the wrong paths, and ruin their experience with your product.</p>\n\n<p>Animation by: <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/LukasStranak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lukáš Straňák</a></p>",

  "description": "<p>Hi guys!</p>\n\n<p>Sharing knowledge and experience is a precious feature of modern design community worldwide. Involved into this movement via active blogging on design issues and wishing to give even more to our readers, in 2016 we started Tubik Magazine, a series of free e-books focused on various aspects of efficient and attractive design. Recently we unveiled some insights into creative process for this educational project featuring design for the first issue called <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/47500033/Design-for-Business-Free-E-Book%0A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“Design for Business”</a>. The book provides designers with definitions and descriptions of business terms and processes having impact on creating user-friendly designs supporting business goals. With today's shot we invite you to check out the <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/47500033/Design-for-Business-Free-E-Book%0A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">full presentation on Behance</a>. Welcome to see the details, download or read it online.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To share more ideas we get working on design projects and concepts, we regularly update <a href=\"http://tubikstudio.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tubik Blog</a> with new articles.
